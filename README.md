**A Diary with a calendar view**

- A calendar view that is **infinitely** scrollable in the vertical direction - both up and down. 
- Headings could be made in a similar fashion, i.e `December 2020` , and the Today button that scrolls back to today's date.

## **Some definitions**

Each rectangular block consisting of a date above is a **Tile**, design of which is shown below. Each Tile can have 0 or 1 entry that would be displayed.
